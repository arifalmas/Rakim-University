            Establishment of the Definition of Science: The Emergence of Rakim University. Introduction: Type of laboratory; Since the emergence of the virus, bacteria, and twin magnetic fields due to α, β, γ rays (positive and negative), twin fields have formed. Due to decreasing oxygen and nitrogen twin magnetic fields, half of our twin dwarf planetary fields are on the way to ruin. A self-conducted research laboratory for a single individual has used two mobile phones and the internet as its toolset. My laboratory collects and analyzes data science information from around the world. It is named the Global Research and Data Science Analysis Center. The ancestral home where I reside serves as the address of the laboratory. It is located in the village of Prannathpur, Union No. 6, Santhahar, Bogra District, Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh, in a house called Prince Palace. 
          <br />
          <br />
          After proving that the Singularity Theory of all branches of fundamental science has been invalidated, there is no definition of science in any university on Earth. It is the will of the Almighty Allah that He has taught His best creation the definition of science through the activities of this laboratory. In April 2024, the activities of this laboratory were transformed into a university named Rakim University. It is a prototype, model school and university. When universities around the world create definitions and curriculums for science based on Black Hole / Rakim’s theory, no theory outside of this university’s theory will be applicable. For example, the theories of Einstein, Hawking, and Max Planck have now become waste — items for the dustbin. The new theory is the Black Hole Field and Anti-Field Twin Theory, Dark Matter or Anti-Field (Anti-Matter) Theory, which remains invisible. It can be seen through illuminated objects with opposite charges. Similarly, all creation is based on the theory of black hole spin of oppositely charged beams in twin formation.

          <br />
          SARS COV 2 to COVID-19 & onwards twin fields have created Black Hole Twin Fields and Anti-Twin Fields, primarily due to the theories of Hawking, Einstein, and Max Planck, which blame human civilization. Analysis and proof of these matters have been created by analyzing data science of civilization from December 20, 2020, to the present. These can be found for free on the Rakim University Website, Facebook, X pages in Bengali & English. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Since I am not a life-long student in English literature, there might be some errors, so please correct the meaning in Bengali, friends. The story of scientific and creation theories is a comprehensible topic from a literary philosophy. 
          <br />
          <br />
          You can find today’s research paper along with all the previous stories on the website, Facebook & X of Rakim University. New discoveries are posted daily on those accounts. Enjoy, friends. Rakim University’s current analysis has also been sent to top social media, ranking universities, and thousands of various institutions and personal pages through those articles. These writings are not given to belittle or elevate anyone. 
          <br />

          Sincerely, 
          Saiful Islam Juboraj — Student, Pen writer, and Founder of Rakim University.
